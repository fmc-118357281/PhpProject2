        <h1><u>Sport</u></h1>
        
        
        <p style="font-family:courier;"> 
            I have taken part in many different sports.
            I enjoy the <i>buzz</i> it gives me, along with the <i>social advantage</i> it offers of meeting new friends.
        Of course, there's also the obvious health benefit of <i>fitness and sanity.</i> I've always been interested in sports, from watching rugby 
        matches on the TV to travelling to foreign countries to perform at festivals.
        Over many years I have tried a variety of sports including: 
        
        <br></br>
        
        <div>
            <table border="1">
            <tr><td><em><b>Sport</b></em></td><td><em><b>No. of years played</b></em></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Football</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Soccer</td><td>5 years</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Hockey</td><td>3 years</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Gymnastics</td><td>3 years</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Boxing</td><td>4 years</td></tr>

    </div>
        
        
        <br></br>
        
        <table>
            <tr><td><h2><em><u>Boxing</u></em></h2></td><td><h2><em><u>Irish Dancing</u></em></h2></td></tr>
      
            <tr><td>My favourite of all, boxing, has been the most rewarding but challenging.
                    <br></br>
                    I began it in 4th years as part of Gaisce presidential award, and I'm glad I did.
                    <br></br>
                    The fitness aspect is very beneficial as training consists of an hour of 
                    running, skipping and HIT training. It also equips me with important self defence skills</td>
            
                    <td>Irish Dancing has been my main sport for many years now.
                    <br></br>
                    I began when I was 4 and have loved it ever since. 
                    The most competitive years came in 2016 and 2017 where I competed at the Irish Dancing World Championships in Glasgow and Dublin.
                    <br></br>
                    I must admit, it took me a while to get used to the wigs, fake tan and fancy dresses, but once you look past
                    that you see the talent and dedication of the dancers.

            <tr><td>Another sport which benefited me a lot was soccer which I played from the age of 9 to 14.
                    <br></br>
                    I played with Richmond, a small team with big players.
                    
                    <br></br>
                    It was through this soccer team that I met many of my childhood friends whom I am still in contact with today.

                <td>Finally, I also played with the school Hockey team in Cholaiste Choilm from 1st to 3rd year.<br></br>
                This consisted of weekly training sessions, where our coach would wear us down with excessive burpees session.<br></br> 
                We also played many and matches throughout the year (which would excuse us from classes to our delight)</td></tr>
