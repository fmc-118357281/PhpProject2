         <p style="font-family:courier;">
             I have travelled to many countries throughout the years, 
             my most frequently visited one being <em>France.</em>
         My family owns a camper van so we used to travel to France every Summer, 
         for the bones of 3 weeks and tour it from top to bottom, 
         sometimes even crossing the border into Spain. 
         This gave me a great thirst for travel, which I hope to satisfy over the years to come. My outstanding plans are to:

         <h3>1)Inter-rail</h3>

         I plan on travelling across Europe with 8 of my friends for 3 weeks during July.
         Our chosen route is:</p>
         
         <h5>Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> Budapest -> Prague -> Lake Bled -> Split</h5>
         
         <br></br>
         
         <h3>2)Work in a resort in France</h3>

         <br></br>
         
         <p>
          I want to experience living and working in a foreign country for a month. 
          From travelling around France when I was younger, I have decided it's the perfect place as I love the people, weather, and culture.
       </p>
         
         <br></br>
         
         <h3>3)Travel Thailand</h3>

         <br></br>
         
         <p>
          I plan on back packing around Thailand with my sister for a Summer, seeing all the islands have to offer. 
          I've heard it's always welcoming, despite it's constant stream of tourists all year round.
